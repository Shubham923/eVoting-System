# Mobile-Based-Voting-System
India is the world’s largest democracy with nearly 900 million eligible voters. India has the world’s second-most expensive elections, after the United States and it spans over a period of 6 weeks. But, currently there is no special provision made for service voter and NRI voter / overseas voters for whom it is difficult to vote in person at the polling station and have to go through a tedious process to cast their vote.
Our aim to create a secure and reliable system through which such voters can cast their vote by simply using their smartphones and exercise their right to vote. 

System is built using Client-Server architecure.
